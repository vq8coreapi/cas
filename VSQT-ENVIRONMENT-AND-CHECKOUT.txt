	autocrlf = true
====================
It should be enough, however if still have issues please read following documentation:
https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings


3). Make sure you have GitHub account and you are added as collaborator.

4). Clone repo and add upstream: https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo
